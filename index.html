                <h1>Introduction</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Angular is an open-source, TypeScript-based framework developed and maintained by Google. It's designed
                to streamline the process of building dynamic and responsive web applications. Angular embraces the
                concept of declarative programming, which means you describe what you want to achieve, and Angular takes
                care of the "how."</p>

            <h2>Angular Highlights:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b> Architecture:</b> Angular follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural
                    pattern, which helps organize your application's code and promotes separation of concerns.</li>
                <li><b>Single Page Applications (SPAs):</b> Angular facilitates the creation of SPAs, where
                    only portions of a page are updated without requiring full page reloads.</li>
                <li><b>Reactive Programming:</b> Angular focuses on reactive programming, which enables seamless
                    handling
                    of asynchronous data streams and user interactions.</li>
                <li><b>Modularization:</b> Angular has a modular structure, where each aspect of your application is
                    encapsulated into components, services, and modules.</li>
                <li><b>TypeScript:</b> Emphasize that Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, to provide
                    static typing, enhanced tooling, and improved code maintainability.</li>
            </ol>

                <h1>What you should already know</h1>
            </header>
            <p>In this section, we'll provide an understanding of the foundational knowledge we expect our readers to
                have before diving into our Angular-based website. We believe that having a certain level of familiarity
                with key concepts will enhance your experience and enable you to make the most of our content.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>A solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is essential. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
                        is the backbone of web content, defining the structure of web pages. CSS (Cascading Style
                        Sheets) is used to style and format the visual presentation of HTML elements. JavaScript, on the
                        other hand, adds interactivity and behavior to web pages, allowing them to respond to user
                        actions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Basic Programming Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, and functions is crucial.
                        These concepts form the building blocks of coding logic and are essential for effective
                        problem-solving and developing dynamic applications.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
                    <p>An understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) is beneficial. The DOM is a programming
                        interface that represents the structure and content of a web page as objects. Manipulating the
                        DOM using JavaScript is a fundamental aspect of creating dynamic and interactive web
                        applications.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Asynchronous Programming</h3>
                    <p>A basic grasp of asynchronous programming concepts is helpful. JavaScript often deals with tasks
                        that may not complete immediately, such as fetching data from a server or responding to user
                        interactions. Understanding asynchronous programming and handling callbacks or promises will aid
                        in creating smoother user experiences.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Version Control (Optional)</h3>
                    <p>While not mandatory, familiarity with version control systems like Git can be advantageous.
                        Version control allows you to track changes to your codebase, collaborate with others, and
                        easily revert to previous versions if needed.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Why?</h3>

                <h1>Angular Overview</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Welcome to the "Angular Overview" section, where we'll provide you with a high-level understanding of the
                Angular framework and its core concepts. As you delve into our website, you'll discover how Angular
                empowers developers to create dynamic, responsive, and feature-rich web applications.</p>
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Components and Component-Based Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Angular is built around the concept of components. A component is a self-contained unit that
                        encapsulates a portion of the user interface along with its behavior and styles. By using
                        components, developers can break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable parts, making the
                        application more modular and maintainable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Data Binding and Reactive Programming</h3>
                    <p>Angular's data binding mechanisms facilitate the synchronization of data between components and
                        their corresponding templates. This allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user
                        interfaces without having to manually update the DOM. Additionally, Angular embraces reactive
                        programming, enabling smooth handling of asynchronous events and data streams.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
                    <p>Angular employs a powerful technique known as dependency injection (DI). DI allows you to define
                        dependencies for your components in a way that promotes loose coupling and reusability. This
                        design pattern enhances code organization and makes testing and maintenance more efficient.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Routing and Single-Page Applications (SPAs)</h3>
                    <p>Angular's routing module enables the creation of single-page applications (SPAs). With SPAs,
                        navigation between different views is seamless, as only portions of the page are updated without
                        the need for full page reloads. This enhances the user experience by providing a more fluid and
                        responsive application.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Directives</h3>
                    <p>Directives are a key feature of Angular that allow you to extend the behavior of HTML elements.
                        Angular provides both built-in and custom directives. Built-in directives, such as ngIf and
                        ngFor, offer powerful ways to conditionally render content and repeat elements based on data.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Services and Dependency Injection</h3>
                    <p>Angular's services provide a way to share data, logic, and functionality across different parts
                        of your application. Services can be injected into components, promoting code reusability and
                        separation of concerns. This approach streamlines code maintenance and testing.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>TypeScript Integration</h3>
                    <p>Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds features like static typing,
                        interfaces, and advanced tooling. TypeScript enhances code quality and helps identify potential
                        issues early in the development process.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="Hello_World" class="section main-section ">
            <hr>
            <header>
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
            </header>
            <p>This classic introductory example will help you become familiar with the basics of setting up an Angular
                project, creating a component, and displaying content in the browser.</p>
            <h3>Creating Your First Angular Project</h3>
            <p>
                To get started, you'll need to have Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) installed. If you haven't
                installed it yet, you can do so using the following command in your terminal/command line:
            </p>
            <code>npm install -g @angular/cli </code>
            <p>Now, let's create a new Angular project:</p>
            <code>ng new hello-world-app</code>
            <p>Follow the prompts to configure your project. Once the project is generated, navigate to the project
                folder:</p>
            <code>cd hello-world-app</code>
            <h3>Creating a Component</h3>
            <code>ng generate component hello-world</code>
            <p>or for short:</p>
            <code>ng g c hello-world</code>
            <p>These two commands both will generate files for your component, including the component class, template,
                styles, and
                unit test.</p>
            <h3>Editing the Component Template</h3>
            <p>Open the generated hello-world.component.html file and replace its content with the following:</p>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Angular World!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
            <h3>Displaying the Component</h3>
            <p>Now that you have your component template ready, let's display it in the main application template.</p>
            <p>Open the app.component.html file and replace its content with the following:</p>
            <code>&lt;app-hello-world&gt;&lt;/app-hello-world&gt;</code>
            <h3>Running the Application</h3>
            <p>You're now ready to see your "Hello World" application in action. Run the following command in the
                terminal/command line to start the development server:</p>
            <code>ng serve</code>
            <p>Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200. You should see the "Hello, Angular World!"
                message displayed on the page.</p>
            <h3>Great job!</h3>
            <p>Congratulations! You've successfully created and run your first Angular application. This simple example
                demonstrates the fundamental steps of setting up a project, generating components, and displaying
                content in the browser. As you explore further, you'll discover how Angular's powerful features enable
                you to build dynamic and interactive web applications with ease.</p>
